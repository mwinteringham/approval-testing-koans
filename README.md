# approval-testing-koans

This repository is designed to help people practise using Approval testing techniques to create Approval testing based tests or update their current asserts to be better at feeding back changes within an application.

## How do I use it?

The codebase is Java and Maven, so simply download or clone the repository and import the Maven project into your favourite Java IDE.

The first set of exercises don't require any additional setup, however the second and third sets of exercises require an application under test which you can find [here at approval-testing-app ](https://github.com/mwinteringham/approval-testing-app). Simply download the latest JAR release and run it using ```java -jar``` and the tests will do the rest of the work.

All you need to do is follow the code comments and update the assertions to use Approval testing approaches.
